  const endBlock = startBlock + 300  // blockchain block number where it will end. 300 is little over an hour.
  const rate = new web3.BigNumber(1000) // rate of ether to Gustavo Coin in wei
  const wallet = web3.eth.accounts[0] // the address that will hold the fund. Recommended to use a multisig one for security.
